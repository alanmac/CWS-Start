            This package is not closed source and will never ever will be. The whole pupose of this project is for people to learn how the 
            website site was built, so any compiled code is easily available by downloading the source code from the project on GitHub

        <h2>Built on BootStrap</h2>
        <p>
            Due to it's popularity and the vast number of themes, jQuery plugins, CSS WebFonts and the such it was a decision to use Bootstrap to build the CWS Start project on it. 
            Rather than having to learn a new framework or a priopitery one that I would have written.
