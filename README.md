CWS Start
=========

This is the new shiny MVC version of Umbraco CWS starter site package built by <a href="http://creativewebspecialist.co.uk" target="_blank">Warren Buckley, an Umbraco vetran to the platform</a>.

###Source Code Available
This package is not closed source and will never ever will be. The whole pupose of this project is for people to learn how the website site was built, so any compiled code is easily available by downloading the source code from the project on GitHub

###Built on BootStrap
Due to it's popularity and the vast number of themes, jQuery plugins, CSS WebFonts and the such it was a decision to use Bootstrap to build the CWS Start project on it. Rather than having to learn a new framework or a priopitery one that I would have written.

###Built for all to learn
This website package starter kit is designed for a vast number of audiences from the absolute novice to Umbraco to the more vetran Umbraco user who may want to pick up a trick or two. So why not take a look through the well documented & commented code and pick up something new today.

###Goals
The goal of this package or starter website for Umbraco, is to allow people to be able to get setup easily with Umbraco and understand one way of building a site with MVC using the Umbraco CMS platform.
So I highly encourage you to take a look through the source code and understand how it all works and even you vetran Umbraco users may pick up a trick or two perhaps.
