CWS Start
=========

This is the new shiny MVC version of Umbraco CWS starter site package built by <a href="http://creativewebspecialist.co.uk" target="_blank">Warren Buckley, an Umbraco vetran to the platform</a>.

###Goals
The goal of this package or starter website for Umbraco, is to allow people to be able to get setup easily with Umbraco and understand one way of building a site with MVC using the Umbraco CMS platform.
So I highly encourage you to take a look through the source code and understand how it all works and even you vetran Umbraco users may pick up a trick or two perhaps.

###Umbraco Credentials
As the source of CWS Start is an Umbraco 6 website and a SQL CE website, you can download the repo and open the solution and hit F5 and simply browse the site and login to start playing with it, using the following credentials.

<strong>Username:</strong> admin<br/>
<strong>Password:</strong> password
